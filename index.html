    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p class="info">
        I was born in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam and moved to America when I was eight.
        I lived in Los Angeles, California for about a year and have been a resident in Austin, Texas since then.
        My alma matter is Texas A&M University, where I received my Bachelor of Science in Sociology with a minor in
        Game Designs and Development.
        I've been coding for about 2 years and I initially thought that I wanted to focus mainly on Game Developemnent
        only (had done a few gaming projects on the side).
        However, my future goal is to become a Full Stack Software Developer and learning more about our intricite
        technology.
        On my free time, I enjoy watching anime (Plus Ultra!) and play video games online (League of Legends, Apex
        Legends, etc.).
        I love traveling and learning new things about the world.
